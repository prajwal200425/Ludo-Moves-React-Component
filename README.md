# Ludo-Moves-React-Component
This is a React functional component named LudoBoard that implements a simple game board for a game of Ludo (also known as Parcheesi). The board displays the current moves for four players: blue, yellow, green, and red. Each player has a button to increment their move count by 1.

The code implements the following features:

State management: The component uses the useState hook to manage the game state, which is an object with four properties: blue, yellow, green, and red, each initialized to 0.
Event handling: The component defines four functions: updateBlue, updateYellow, updateGreen, and updateRed, each of which updates the corresponding player's move count when their button is clicked.
UI rendering: The component returns a JSX element that renders a game board with four sections, each displaying the current move count for a player and a button to increment that count.
Styling: The buttons are styled with different background colors to match the player colors.
Overall, this code provides a basic implementation of a Ludo game board with interactive buttons to update the move counts for each player.
